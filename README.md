# Drought Analysis

This is an unpublished ongoing student project of drought analysis using Google Earth Engine (GEE). This is part of a group work about drought analysis by MSc students in Department of Earth Sciences, Uppsala University:
de Mendonça Fileni, Felipe; Erikson, Torbjörn-Johannes; Feng, Shunan   
Supervisor: Pettersson, Rickard; Winterdahl, Mattias                   

Preliminary results will be presented during EGU general assembly 2019 in Vienna.
Please copy the script to GEE: https://code.earthengine.google.com/ and run. Or using the links if available in readme.

1. NDVI vs Water Balance NOAH.js
spatial correlation of water balance(NOAH 0.25 degree) and NDVI (landsat 30m)
2. downloadnoah.py
downloading data from earthdata.nasa.gov
3. SPEI vs NDVI
It exports and displays the correlation map of monthly SPEI vs the sum of coming three-month NDVI anomalies. The example in this script is California, 1984-2018. For the access to SPEI, please contact us.
4. Corrmap Display with lucc
The correlation map exported to GEE asset from SEPI vs NDVI.js could be diaplayed and analyzed in this script. R and P values would be reported by different land cover.
